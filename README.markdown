CalendarJS
==========

#### Build large format calendars in JavaScript ####

This plugin is built using prototype.js and is likely not suitable for most 
production sites today. However, if the time comes where there is a desire
to support it on jQuery/zepto, I will rewrite it. In the mean time...

CalendarJS is a JavaScript widget that allows you to instantiate a calendar widget on 
demand, and fill it with color-coded events, and attach controls to specific dates,
months, and years. It provides an API to attaching events and loading / unloading
content based on events that happen on certain dates. 

Current Version 
---------------

1.0.0 (Last updated 2007-03-07)

Dependencies
------------

This plugin requires prototype JS version 1.6 or above (http://prototypejs.org)

TODO
----

Assuming there is a call for it, the following work needs doing:

* Convert to a more recent JS library (i.e., jQuery or zepto for starters)
* Changes to the API to allow for more functionality
* Minification
* I wrote this all the way back in 2007. Be gentle :)

Examples!
---------

See a live, working demonstration here : http://labs.untropy.net/calendar/

Documentation

Pending. For now, please see the example above and the documentation in `src/untropy_calendar.js`
